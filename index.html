                    <p>Women's history month - observed annually in the month of March — is a perfect occasion to
                        discover more about the female revolutionaries, politicians and campaigners who are simply too
                        important to be forgotten. </p>

                        <p>"We may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated." -- Maya Angelou</p>

                    <h2>Alice Palmer</h2>
                    <p>Her career in education opened the gates to more opportunities for women to attend college. She
                        co-founded and served as president of the American Association of University Women. She served
                        as President of Wellesley College from 1881 to 1887. From 1892 to 1895 she served as Dean of
                        Women at the University of Chicago. And she accomplished all of these things before women were
                        legally allowed to vote!</p>
                    <h3>Womens Olympic Swimmer</h3>
                    <h2>Birgit Fischer</h2>
                    <p>By the time she graduated from her army sports boarding school, Fischer was already the youngest
                        champion in the history of Olympic kayaking. She had won gold in the K1 500m at the 1980 Moscow
                        Games aged just 20, setting the tone for her incredible career.</p>
